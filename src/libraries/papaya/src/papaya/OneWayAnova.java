/**

 * Computes the one-way ANOVA p-value to test the equality of two or more sample
 * means by analyzing the sample variances using the test statistic 
 * <code>F = variance between samples / variance within samples</code>.
 * Once initialized, the following values are computed and stored:
 * <ul>
 * <li>dfbg: degrees of freedom between the groups ({@link dfbg()}).
 * <li>ssbg: sum of squared deviates between the groups ({@link ssbg()}).
 * <li>dfwg: degrees of freedom within the groups, or "Error" dfs ({@link dfwg()}).
 * <li>sswg: sum of squared deviates within the groups ({@link sswg()}).
 * <li>F: the test statistic, computed as (ssbg/dfbg) / (sswg/dfwg) ({@link F()}).
 * <li>pValue: the p-value, or significance level, corresponding to a two-tailed
 * null hypothesis of no difference between the samples ({@link pValue()}).
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p><strong>Preconditions</strong>: <ul>
 * <li>The categoryData <code>Collection</code> must contain
 * <code>float[]</code> arrays.</li>
 * <li> There must be at least two <code>float[]</code> arrays in the
 * <code>categoryData</code> collection and each of these arrays must
 * contain at least two values.</li></ul></p>
 * 
 * <p>This implementation is based on a description provided in Chapter 13 of the VassarStats
 * <a href="http://faculty.vassar.edu/lowry/ch13pt1.html" target="_blank">online textbook</a>
 * Mean values are not computed directly in the algorithm as this tends to cause round-off error.
 * Rather, we use the more stable <code>SumOfSquares - Sum^2</code>:
 * <pre>
 * Sum_(i=1 to n) (x_i - mean(x) )^2 = Sum_(i=1 to n)(x_i)^2 - (Sum_(i=1 to n) x_i)^2/n.
 * </pre>
 * </p>
