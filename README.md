AF_demo_processing
==================

This demo for Processing shows a system identification task in which 'n' least-mean-squares adaptive filters (LMS-AFs), with different step sizes, try to estimate the plant coefficients. The 2D coordinates (x,y) of the point named 'Target' are collected in the so-called optimum vector wo = [x, y]', which is the system to be estimated.
